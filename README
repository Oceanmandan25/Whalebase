#DSSA Practicum Capstone 

## Where is the data from
The data is collected by the Cape May Whale Watch and Research Center

## How was it collected
Species, behavioral, and environmental data are collected onboard the 98ft MV American Star
via a team of naturalists and interns, using instruments such as a Simrad NSS evo3 Chart Plotter to get temperature and depth data,
and a handheld GPS Map 73 to get time and coordinate data.
Photos were collected onboard as well, using a 300mm zoom lens

##How was the data cleaned/transformed
The larger dataset was cleaned during a prior project, using the physical records taken on each trip to check and confirm each row of sighting data.
The photo data was taken and cleaned by extracting a left dorsal, right dorsal, and fluke photo from each sighting.
If one of the three aformentioned photos were missing from a sighting it was marked as not present

##What program was used to clean the photos
R Studio was used to clean all the data

##How was the data cleaned and transformed
In terms of the photo data, as there was no initial dataset to be downloaded, all photos were named for the corresponding humpback they belonged to.
The name, alternate IDs and dorsal characteristics for each whale from the existing format of the catalog were provided,
and wrapped in a list function to create a searchable dataset.
Coordinate data for the map was placed in a base R leaflet map and searched for coordinates that did not occur within a regular range of Cape May NJ

##What are the units for the numeric data
The main numeric columns were the coordinates and time data
The time data had units of m/d/y
The coordinates data had a unit of degrees

##What are the definitions for the column names

##If there are set variable options in your dataset, what are their definitions

##What are the regulations to using the data
All guidelines must be followed as presented by the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972, 
as well as any voluntary guidelines presented by Whale SENSE in terms of how the data is used
